PhysioNet
---------

Some of the electrocardiogram (ECG) diagrams in the course notes were produced using the resources of [PhysioNet](http://www.physionet.org/), especially the [MIT-BIH Arryhthmia Database Directory](http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/).

For more information on PhysioNet, consult this article: Goldberger A. L., L. A. N. Amaral, L. Glass, J. M. Hausdorff, P. Ch. Ivanov, R. G. Mark, J. E. Mietus, G. B. Moody, C. K. Peng, and H. E. Stanley.

Cardiovascular Simulator ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/related-resources/cvsim))
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cardiovascular Simulator is a dynamic computer simulation of human cardiovascular hemodynamics, primarily intended for students of physiology and medicine. It is implemented on engineering workstations running the X Window System, allowing the student to perform a variety of measurements in a real-time simulated cardiovascular system, not all of which would be possible in an animal laboratory. The simulation is based on the lumped-parameter mathematical model taught in Quantitative Physiology and Cardiovascular Pathophysiology courses in the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. The computer simulation is implemented on the MIT Project Athena student computing network.
