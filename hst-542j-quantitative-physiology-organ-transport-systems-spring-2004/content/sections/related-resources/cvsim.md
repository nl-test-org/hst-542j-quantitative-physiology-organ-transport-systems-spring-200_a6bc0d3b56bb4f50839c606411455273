description: 'Handout containing an overview of the Cardiovascular Simulator. The
  Cardiovascular Simulator is a dynamic computer simulation of human cardiovascular

  hemodynamics,primarily intended for students of physiology and medicine. It is implemented
  on engineering workstations running the X Window System,allowing the student to
  perform a variety of measurements in a real-time simulated cardiovascular system,not
  all of which would be possible in an animal laboratory. The simulation is based
  on the lumped-parameter mathematical model taught in Quantitative Physiology and
  Cardiovascular Pathophysiology courses in the Harvard-M.I.T. Division of Health
  Sciences and Technology. The computer simulation is implemented on the M.I.T. Project
  Athena student computing network.'
